# MinTone
Minimal tone generator

This little app, at least upon conception through alpha, is an extremely minimalistic tone generator for 'droid phones.  It features three preset radio buttons, a manual numeric entry field, and a seekbar for different frequency selection options.  While initially it was going to just play each tone for a preset duration, it seems that it would be much more useful if it had an option for continuous tone generation until toggled off.  So, with that, and a few other thoughts as far as varying sample rate, and changing the available frequency presets, I've decided to add a small control panel, and the capability to save user settings.

It would be good, at some point, to try to implement this in a fashion capable of audio playback, while other audio resources are being utilized, as well.  I believe that's about it for now...
